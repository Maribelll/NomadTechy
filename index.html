            Hi there, please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ven Shuda
            and I am the owner and head IT Administrator here at NomadTechy IT
            Consulting and Services LLC operating out of Port St. Lucie,
            Florida. <br />
            <br />In my career, I have been very fortunate to be mentored by
            whom I consider to be the best and brightest people in my industry.
            My experience with MSPs over the years has given me much exposure
            and diversity to how an MSP would approach their client’s tailored
            technological business needs to help them excel in their industry.
            Bringing that knowledge and best practice to NomadTechy is what I
            believe separates us from the rest.<br /><br />
            Here at NomadTechy, our mission is simple: Enhance Customer Success
            - by doing I.T Best! <br /><br />Looking forward to doing business
            with you soon.
